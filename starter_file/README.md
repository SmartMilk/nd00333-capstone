# Udacity Nanodegree - Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project

For the final project of the Udacity Nanodegree - Machine Learning Engineer, I have chosen to use the popular UCI dataset Census Income dataset(referred to as the "salary" dataset). The main objective of this project is to construct models via AutoML and HyperDrive Azure models and select the best model that can predict whether an individual, based on their census characteristics, will have an annual salary exceeding $50k. The resultant best model is then deployed and validated as a REST endpoint on Azure Container Instance. 


## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

To download the Kaggle dataset, a Kaggle account is required to create the authorization credentials. Once an account has been created, you can generate the json file containing the relevant credentials by going to Kaggle's account settings and selecting the 'generate api' option. Add the kaggle.json file to your working directory. No other special steps are required.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
Link to video: https://youtu.be/--lG2rcdYYY
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
